dataset-spring
==============

This plugin contains the routes for the dataset parsers in the OOI Uframe implementation.

It's a submodule to uframe-ooi under edex/com.raytheon.uf.edex.ooi.decoder.dataset.spring.
To capture changes to this repository into uframe-ooi's submodules run:
```commandline
cd <uframe-ooi repository root folder>
git submodule update
```

Once this is done the changes must be added, committed, pushed and merged as normal.
